# Social-Proof-Section
This is a challenge set by  https://www.frontendmentor.io/. I was given designs to replicate and I have done so to the best of my knowledge
with HTML and CSS/SASS at the time of completion.

## Technologies 
-HTML -CSS -SASS 

### About
This is my second project I have completed from https://www.frontendmentor.io/. This was a really enjoyable project for me to complete.
I built it with mobile first optimisations in mind, the hardest part of this was the positioning of the various elements when going into a larger screen 
format. This project has improved my overall thought process when it comes to laying out HTML and also using more advanced SASS syntax to create a visually 
identical copy of the designs given.
